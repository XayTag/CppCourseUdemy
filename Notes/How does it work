- Computer Program is like a Recipe
- When you write code you need to be very very explicit about what the computer should do

- The code we write is source code
- Source Code is generally higher level than computer code (understanable by humans)
- We write code in Editors they are specifically designed to write "Recipes" in a specific programming language
- Source Code needs to be translated into form that's understandable by computers (object code)
- Compiler is the translator for Source code to object code
- Linker links all our object code and others in form of libraries and creates an executable Program

Editor (To Enter our Code or edit existing code) -> Compiler (if there are no mistakes in the source code the compiler will generate a object code file for every source code file) -> Linker (Links our object files and external libraries togehter) -> EXECUTABLE FILE

- C++ file extentions (.cpp | .h | .cc | .hpp ...)
